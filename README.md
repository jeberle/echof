# Sample code to demonstrate missing EOF notifications

## Summary

When using the `NSNotificationCenter` with `NSFileHandle`
`readInBackgroundAndNotify`, a process that waits for a writer
to close a FIFO can block forever, as it does not receive an
event containing a zero-length `NSData` object.

## Contents

    Makefile  - to build echof program
    README.md - this file
    echof.m   - echof source. this is an echo server that uses 2 fifos
    kit.h     - precompiled header
    test.py   - test client

## To Build

    make

## To Run

   mkfifo f1 f2
   ./echof

   ... in another console ...

   ./test.py 5

In my tests, I get about 3 good runs (such that both programs exit normally)
until `echof` hangs, waiting for the client to close its write end, which it
obviously does by not running anymore.

When run with `./test.py 1` it _always_ hangs.

I don't think this has anything to do w/ buffering, a common gremlin w/ this sort
of work.
